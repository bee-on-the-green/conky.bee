This a work in progress to create a matrix style piece of ASCII art for Android and/or Linux (with a fast refresh rate)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 FINAL GOAL: On top of the Matrix part, I would like to include the folowing features:

  
  - A lot of settings to enable the user to fine tune the default settings (settings as a popup window)
  - Display pictures (very short display to create a subminal effect (would require access of user's Pictures directory.
  - Get text from text files / PDF / movies subtitles. Maybe some data scrapped from the Net ...
  - Why not including a piece of software such as GPT4ALL with some agency?



NOTE: my knowledge of programing is very limited. I know a bit of Bash, and I started to use Kotlin very recently.
But I managed to achieve some results, and I am sure that I can only improve. I am using Copilot without copy paste:
I do not understand Kotlin very well, so I limit myself to boiler plate (in a nutshell, I use Kotlin "Bash style")

What matter is an aesthetic result!
