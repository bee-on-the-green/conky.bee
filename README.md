# conky.bee

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This a work in progress to create an interactive and AI driven desktop conky. It is primarilly a fun orientated project, but it might become quite useful to the user:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* It is not a real conky, as it is not "hard coded" in the computer wallpaper.
* The conky provides the usual geek stuff such as temp, ram usage, etc. (I have already sort of managed that, despite my poor programing knowledge).
* The user would press a key/click to access settings an options.
* A second window would then pop up, featuring pictures/videos/random quotes such as parts of books or email). This list is non exhaustive, but the main thing is that all the output would be relevant to the user queries or needs.


 FINAL GOAL:
 ------------
 
 * Via the main window, the user would be able to 'speak' to his own machine (voice or text).
 * Thanks to an AI run locally, the user would get output in a secondary window (please note that the AI program needs to be run locally in order to avoid the 'censorship' issues of commercial AI programs such as chat GPT)
 * Bellow are the features that I would like to implement, if possible.

        1. Getting images/videos relevant to the user query.
        2. Perform internet queries.
        3. Ask questions
        4. Act as a reminder/calendar.

* The AI would have (as long as the user wish so) full access to the user's data.
* It would take time to train the AI program, as the machine would need to know its user.
* Bearing in mind that many people have 2 or more monitors, the window would not be invasive (or would be, provided the user chooses to do so)

 
ULTIMATE GOAL:
---------------

* Enjoying the help of a full assistant, an assistant that would know the user better than her/him.
* Unlike services such as Google/Meta/Open AI, the data will remain private, and "uncesored"
* The user would retain control over the AI: anything from a cool and forgiving "sister" to an unforgiving and cold machine that would tell the blunt truth and "force" the user to face reality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DREAM FEATURE (probably impossible to achieve, but hardware as well as software is improving at a fast pace)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Conkies belonging to different users that would be able to communicate with each other to share knowlege/ideas, and then provide input to the users. A sort of "community" of machines :) 
* Thanks to the webcam, the machine would be able to decipher the user's reactions (facial expression recognition) and therefore know its user better.


----------
NOTES:
----------

* So far, the conky is very basic and can only display very basic information. I am anything but a pro (not even a gamer, nor a  geek, just a "people's person", nothing more). The truth is that I am struggling. Six months ago I would not have thought that I would be able to give written instructions to a computer (I got interested in Bash just to back up my precious data in a safe and efficient way). But I quickly got hooked: I find Bash absolutly fascinating. Also, I had never heard of GitHub: also a fashinating discovery, as I can really relate to the sharing mindset of the people involved.

* I started this project for fun: all I want is to improve my digital environment.

* Also, with all the hype arround chat GPT, I have tried very basic open source desktop AI. That's why I would like to improve my script to include this type of technology. Indeed, I was very impressed by the machine's answers, taking into account that the "data file" being only 4GB!)

* Finally, I recently came accross the "Kitty" terminal emulator: it has many of the features I need (especially to display images). And I have realized that it is not that difficult to customize.

* Obviously, any help would be more than welcome. I am trying hard, but I am doing everyting thanks to YouTube tutorial: very useful but it is just not good enough. I am spending more and more time on the Bash section of Stackoverflow: I do not even understand 20 percent of what I read, but things are getting better bit by bit (I do not allow myself to copy and paste, as there is no fun in doing that).
