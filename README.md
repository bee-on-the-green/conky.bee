---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This a work in progress to create an interactive, and AI driven desktop conky. It is primarilly a fun orientated project, but it might become quite useful to the user:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* It is not a real conky, as it is not "hard coded" in the computer wallpaper.
* The conky provides the usual geek stuff such as temp, ram usage, etc. (I have already sort of managed that).
* The user would only need to press a key to access the real thing (the "geek" conky being just a mean/excuse to access the AI; it could be anything else)
* A second window would then pop up, with the AI ready to interact with the user (via keyboard; speech recognition if possible)

 FINAL GOAL:
 ------------
 
 * Thanks to an AI run locally, the user would get the AI output in a secondary window (please note that the AI program needs to be run locally in order to avoid the 'censorship' issues of commercial AI programs such as chat GPT)
 
 * Bellow are the features that I would like to implement, if possible.

        1. Getting images/videos relevant to the user query.
        2. Perform internet queries.
        3. Ask questions
        4. Act as a reminder/calendar.

* The AI would have (as long as the user wish so) full access to the user's data.
* It would take time to train the AI program, as the machine would need to know its user.
* Bearing in mind that many people have 2 or more monitors, the window would not be invasive (or would be, provided the user chooses to do so)

 
ULTIMATE GOAL:
---------------

* Enjoying the help of a full assistant, an assistant that would know the user better than her/him.
* Unlike services such as Google/Meta/Open AI, the data will remain private, and "uncesored" (everything run locally). Having said that, a website could be usefull to help user to finen thune the program, and provide the ability to exchange tips with other users)
* The user would retain control over the AI: anything from a cool and forgiving "sister" to an unforgiving and cold machine that would tell the blunt truth and "force" the user to face reality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DREAM FEATURES (probably impossible to achieve, but hardware as well as software is improving at a fast pace)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Conkies belonging to different users that would be able to communicate with each other to share knowlege/ideas, and then provide input to the users. A sort of "community" of machines :) 
* Thanks to the webcam, the machine would be able to decipher the user's reactions (facial expression recognition) and therefore know its user better.


----------
NOTES:
----------

* So far, the conky is very basic (it is only able to grab 'Htop' kind of information. I am anything but a pro (not even a gamer, nor a  geek, just a "people's person", nothing more). The truth is that I am struggling. Six months ago I would not have thought that I would be able to give written instructions to a computer (I got interested in Bash just to back up my precious data in a safe and efficient way). But I quickly got hooked: I find Bash absolutly fascinating. Also, I had never heard of GitHub: also a fashinating discovery, as I can really relate to the sharing mindset of the people involved.

* I started this project for fun: all I want is to improve my digital environment, and get help from a proactive machine.

* With all the hype arround chat GPT, I have tried very basic open source desktop AI. That's why I would like to improve my script to include this type of technology. Indeed, I was very impressed by the machine's answers, taking into account that the "data file" being only 4GB!)

* Finally, I recently came accross the "Kitty" terminal emulator: it has many of the features I need (especially to display images). And I have realized that it is not that difficult to customize.

* Obviously, any help would be more than welcome. I am doing everyting thanks to YouTube tutorial, very useful but it is just not good enough. I do not even understand 20 percent of what I read in Stackoverflow, but things are getting better bit by bit.

* I do not allow myself to copy and paste, as there is no fun in doing that.

PLEASE FIND BELLOW A DRAFT OF THE INTERFACE (IN THAT PARTTICULAR CASE, A CONKY THAT MIGHT BE APRECIATED BY GAMERS AS WELL AS NERDS)
