# conky.bee

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This a work in progress to create an interactive desktop conky. It is primarilly a fun orientated project, but it might become quite useful to the user:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* It is not a real conky, as it is not "hard coded" in the computer wallpaper.
* The conky provides the usual geek stuff such as temp, ram usage, etc. (I have already sort of managed that, despite my poor programing knowledge).
* The user would just need to press a key/click to change the window and access more advance settings.
* A second window would then appear, featuring pictures/videos/random quotes such as parts of books/emails). This list is non exhaustive.


 FINAL GOAL:
 ------------
 
 * Via the main window, the user would be able to 'speak' to his own machine.
 * Thanks to an AI run locally, the user would get output in a secondary window (please note that the AI program needs to be run locally in order to avoid the 'censorship' issues of commercial AI programs such as chat GPT)
 * Bellow are the features that I would like to implement, if possible.

        1. Getting images/videos relevant to the user query.
        2. Perform internet queries.
        3. Ask questions
        4. Act as a reminder/calendar.

* The AI would have (as long as the user wish so) full access to the user's data.
* Bearing in mind that many people have 2 or more monitors, the window would not be invasive (or would be, provided the user chooses so)

 
ULTIMATE GOAL:
---------------

* Enjoying the help of a full assistant, an assistant that would know the user better than her/him.
* Unlike services such as Google/Meta/Open AI, the data will remain private, and "uncesored"
* The user would retain control over the AI: anything from a cool and forgiving "sister" to an unforgiving and cold machine that would tell the truth and force the user to face reality.

-----------------------------------------------
DREAM FEATURE (probably impossible to achieve)
-----------------------------------------------

Conkies belonging to different users that would be able to communicate with each other to share knowlege/ideas, and then provide input to the users. A sort of "community" of machines :)

NOTE:
----------

* So far, the conky is very basic and can only display very basic information. I am anything but a pro (not even a gamer, nor a  geek, just a "people's person", nothing more). The truth is that I am struggling. Six months ago I would not have thought that I would be able to give written instructions to a computer (I got interested in Bash just to back up my precious data in a safe and efficient way). But I quickly got hooked: I find Bash absolutly fascinating. Also, I had never heard of GitHub: also a fashinating discovery, as I can really relate to the sharing mindset of the people involved.

* I started this project for fun: all I want is to improve my digital environment.

* Also, with all the hype arround chat GPT, I have tried very basic open source desktop AI. That's why I would like to improve my script to include this type of technology.

* Finally, I have also discovered the "Kitty" terminal emulator: it has many of the features I need (especially to display images). I have realized that it is not that difficult to customize.

* Obviously, any help would be more than welcome. I am trying hard, but I am doing everyting thanks to YouTube tutorial. It is just not good enough. I am spending more and more time on the Bash section of Stackoverflow: I do not understand even 20 percent of what I read, but things are getting better bit by bit (I do not allow myself to copy and paste, as there is no fun in doing that).
